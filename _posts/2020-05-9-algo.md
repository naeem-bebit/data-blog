# Data Structures
Different ways of storing data on the computer or more simple way is a database

## Array
Collection of items in single type

array cant be changed, once it has defined, it cannot be changed. 
For example in Python it's called tuple
```python
tuple1 = (1,2,3)
```
`tuple1` cannot be changed since it's immutable, thus in order to change the tuple it must be converted to the list first and add another element to the list via `append` and change it back to tuple.
Once a tuple is created, you cannot add items to it. Tuples are unchangeable.
Example:
```python
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
```
Example:
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
thistuple[3] = "orange" # This will raise an error
```

### Memory
a long tape of bytes (byte is a small unit of data consists of 8 bits)
Ram - temporary memory
Disk - permenant memory

## Linked List

## Built-in Data Structures

- List
- Dictionary
- Set
- Tuple

## User-Defined Data Structures

- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Linked List
- Graph
- HashMap
- many more
(build mindmap using the data structures)
 
# Algorithm
Operations on different data structures and sets of instructions for executing it or simplay way to define it is programming
