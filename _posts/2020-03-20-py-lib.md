In this post, I would like to share about the useful Python libraries.

## [Pyforest](https://pypi.org/project/pyforest/)

Lazy-import of all popular Python Data Science libraries. Stop writing the same imports over and over again.

```bash
pip install pyforest
```
or
```bash
pip install --upgrade pyforest
```
It supports almost most of the popular libraries such as pd(pandas), np(numpy), sklearn etc. You can check the supported libraries by running below command

```python
dir(pyforest)
```

In the jupyter notebook just run command below and you dont have to import for each libraries when you want to use it.
```python
import pyforest
```
To check what libraries you have imported you can run command below
```python
active_imports()
```

Then you dont have to import all the libraries at the beginning each time, so give it a try!

## [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html)

How to install it
```bash
pip install fbprophet
```
python import
```python
from fbprophet import Prophet
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
m = Prophet()
m.fit(df)

#The predict method will assign each row in future a predicted value
forecast = m.predict(future)
forecast[['ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']].tail()
#Plot
fig1 = m.plot(forecast)
fig2 = m.plot_components(forecast)

#It also has it owns plot
from fbprophet.plot import plot_plotly
import plotly.offline as py
py.init_notebook_mode()

fig = plot_plotly(m, forecast)  # This returns a plotly Figure
py.iplot(fig)
```

## Code Formatter Black
[Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter](https://github.com/psf/black)
[A simple extension for Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab to beautify Python code automatically using Black](https://github.com/dnanhkhoa/nb_black)

```bash
pip install nb_black
```

For Jupyter Notebook

```bash
%load_ext nb_black
```

```python
d = {"a": 1, "b":2, 
     'c' : "nikhil"}
```

Formatted
```python
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": "nikhil"}
```

## Progress Bar in Jupyter notebook

Library [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

In the Jupyter notebook

```python
from tqdm import trange
from time import sleep

for i in trange(100):
    sleep(0.01)
```
## Code Refactoring

### [Radon](https://pypi.org/project/radon/)

```bash
pip install radon
```
Radon is a Python tool that computes various metrics from the source code. Radon can compute:

- McCabe’s complexity, i.e. cyclomatic complexity
- raw metrics (these include SLOC, comment lines, blank lines, &c.)
- Halstead metrics (all of them)
- Maintainability Index (the one used in Visual Studio)

## [Data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#Callable%20types)
### Special Methods 
- under under method under under  = Dunder 
```python
__name__ == __main__:
  main()
```


The function’s name.

You can refer for more information about [Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

## streamlit
```python
import streamlit as st

## Title
st.title("Hello World")

## Markdown
st.markdown("This example of Markdown")

## Header/subheader
st.header("Header")
st.subheader("Subheader")

## Colourful(Error/Information)
st.successful("Successful")
st.warning("Error")
st.info("Information")
st.error("Error")
st.exception("Exception")

from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("example.jpg")

import datetime

today = st.date_input("Today is ", datetime.datetime.now)
the_time = st.time_input("The time is",datetime.time())
```
