# WIP (Work in Progress)

In this post, I would like to share about the useful Python libraries.

### [pyforest](https://pypi.org/project/pyforest/)

Lazy-import of all popular Python Data Science libraries. Stop writing the same imports over and over again.

```bash
pip install pyforest
```
or
```bash
pip install --upgrade pyforest
```
It supports almost most of the popular libraries such as pd(pandas), np(numpy), sklearn etc. You can check the supported libraries by running below command

```python
dir(pyforest)
```

In the jupyter notebook just run command below and you dont have to import for each libraries when you want to use it.
```python
import pyforest
```
To check what libraries you have imported you can run command below
```python
active_imports()
```

Then you dont have to import all the libraries at the beginning each time, so give it a try!
