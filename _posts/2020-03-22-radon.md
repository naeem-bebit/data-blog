## Code Refactoring

### [Radon](https://pypi.org/project/radon/)

```bash
pip install radon
```
Radon is a Python tool that computes various metrics from the source code. Radon can compute:

- McCabeâ€™s complexity, i.e. cyclomatic complexity
- raw metrics (these include SLOC, comment lines, blank lines, &c.)
- Halstead metrics (all of them)
- Maintainability Index (the one used in Visual Studio)
