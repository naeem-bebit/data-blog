# WIP (Work in Progress)

## Python

### The Zen of Python
#### by Tim Peters
```python
import this
```

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

# \_\_main__

# \_\_init__

# decorators

# Class and object

Object is the subset of the class. The object is created by the defined object 
Class Example:
```python
class Class_Name:
  def __init__(self, att_1, att_2, att_3):
    self.att_1 = att_1
    self.att_2 = att_2
    self.att_3 = att_3

  def function_class(self):
    print(self.att_1)
```
## Method
Add `self` to each of the method of the class `Class_Name`
```python
def function_class(self):
```
## Constructor
The custome constructor like example below is how to define the attributes in more efficient way
```python
def __init__(self, att_1, att_2, att_3):
```

Therefore to run the example of the `Class` above 
```python
variable1 = Class_Name(att_1, att_2, att_3)
```
