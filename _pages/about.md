I have a Computer Engineering (CE) background as all of my degrees are in CE. After my Bachelor, I was doing my higher education in the field of Image processing (back then, image processing was Engineering field rather than Computer Science) when the Data revolution took shape. People were more familiar with the word “Big Data” at the time rather than Data Science or Machine Learning and even Neural Networks. 

Then, I got hooked up with Machine Learning and started steering my career path towards Data Science since. Upon realizing where my passion lies, I left my comfort zone and self-taught Data Science skills. I had a bit of good start with Image Processing background, especially in programming, so I didn’t have to start from scratch. Despite that, I encountered numerous obstacles trying to make the cut into the field of Data Science (yeah, I read statistics books again).

It was quite confusing to me at the time since I didn’t know where to start, what skills I need to sharpen, how I should form my resume, etc. If you are reading this and have similar situations, I hope you find this helpful.
