# WIP (Work in Progress)

## What is Git?
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency 

## Why data science need to use Git?

Using Git in a group project allows for several developers to work on the same project independently without constantly interfering with each otherâ€™s input. Each developer can get an independent version of the code that they can modify without taking the risk of destroying a stable version of the code.

The ability to duplicate the code and work independently on a different version of it makes Git a good option for anyone building an application, even a developer working alone. It gives you the opportunity to keep several versions of your code and keep track of all characteristics of each change, such as who did the change and when.

## Basic command -- will add more explanation later
```bash
git add 
git commit
git push
git pull
git fetch
git rebase
git remote
git merge
```  

## Few examples of Git repository
